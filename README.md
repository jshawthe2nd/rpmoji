# RPmoJi

A repo for my personal React + Redux project, RPmoJi, which is based off traditional 16-bit JRPG video game designs made popular by games like Final Fantasy, Chrono Trigger, etc

If you clone the repo, and run it with `npm start`, you should see the game start in the overworld. You can move the party around with the `w a s d` keys (but not more than one at a time), but currently the party can be moved beyond the map boundaries. 

You can open the game menu by pressing the `enter` key, but, there's still some janky CSS with this. You should still be able to equip gear, and use items and spells to cure and heal the top two party members. You also may close the `Spells` menu by right-clicking it. If a Mage character doesn't have enough MP, you won't be able to cast it.

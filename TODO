      clearing the classes on Character components:
        So I handled the item quantity case for the UI,
        but now I need to figure out how to properly have
        the Character watch itself for when its stats values
        have been restored to max, and disable the classes
        appropriately to return the UI to where
        it needs to be.
        update: pretty sure I can rely on the
        canItemBeUsed paradigm to dispatch necessary
        actions

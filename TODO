      clearing the classes on Character components:
        So I handled the item quantity case for the UI,
        but now I need to figure out how to properly have
        the Character watch itself for when its stats values
        have been restored to max, and disable the classes
        appropriately to return the UI to where
        it needs to be.
        update: pretty sure I can rely on the
        canItemBeUsed paradigm to dispatch necessary
        actions
        In the end, what I ended up doing was writing an action
        creator that returned a function that received a dispatch
        and getState function as arguments, and used those to check
        state of the character stat and deactivate the item to return
        the UI to its regular state.

Bugfixes:
  ✔ make sure onCharacterSelect only fires when applying item not when selecting for weapon or armor @done(20-09-23 22:24)
  ✔ Fixed a bug where I wasn't properly checking the current character's state in Redux and therefore couldn't properly react to state changes and decide if we needed to deactivate the current item because the character's current stat value had met or exceeded their max value. @done(21-02-26 03:12)
